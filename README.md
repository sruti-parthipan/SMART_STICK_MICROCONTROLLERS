# SMART_STICK_USING_MICROCONTROLLERS
Smart Blind Guidance System - GitHub Project

This project introduces an affordable and user-friendly smart blind guidance system, accessible on GitHub. By integrating ultrasonic detectors into a walking stick, obstacles are detected, triggering alerts for enhanced mobility. The addition of a buzzer for notifications and a water detector to prevent slipping further augments the system's safety features. The GitHub repository provides comprehensive documentation, making it easy for developers and enthusiasts to understand and contribute to this cost-effective solution. Join us in the mission to empower the visually impaired community with improved independence and secure navigation.

**WORKING:**<BR>
The smart stick is integrated with ultrasonic sensor along with water sensing sensor. Our proposed project first uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles ahead using ultrasonic waves. On sensing obstacles, the sensor passes this data to the microcontroller. The microcontroller then processes this data and calculates if the obstacle is close enough. If the obstacle is not that close the circuit does nothing. If the obstacle is close the microcontroller sends a signal to sound a buzzer. The LCD display shows the distance between the stick and the obstacles.  The water sensor fit at the bottom of the stick to sense obstacle  like  water  pits, puddles and water spread. Once wires touch water, the circuit is shorted, this interrupts the microcontroller, activates the vibration motor.
